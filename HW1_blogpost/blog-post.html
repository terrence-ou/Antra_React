          HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of web
          development. It's a markup language that instructs web browsers on how
          to structure and display content on web pages.
        </summary>
        <p>
          HTML does this by using a variety of tags and attributes, acting as
          the building blocks of websites, enabling the creation of visually
          engaging pages that can include text, images, links, and much more.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="article__quote">
          At its core, HTML is relatively straightforward,
          <strong>designed to be easy to learn and use</strong>. It works by
          marking up text to define different elements like headings,
          paragraphs, lists, links, and other components crucial to web design.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Each element in HTML is enclosed in tags, which are made up of angle
          brackets surrounding an element type (for example, for paragraphs).
          These elements tell the browser how to display the content or
          interpret the page's structure.
        </p>
        <h2>Heading</h2>
        In summary, HTML is a vital skill for anyone looking to create or
        understand web content. Its simplicity and versatility make it the
        starting point for anyone interested in web development or design.
        <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
        As you become more comfortable with HTML, you can start to explore CSS
        (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, which allow you to further
        style and add interactivity to your web pages, respectively.

          HTML5 introduced a wide array of improvements and new features over
          its predecessors, making web development more intuitive, efficient,
          and capable of handling multimedia and graphical content without the
          need for external plugins. Here are some key features of HTML5.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced more descriptive HTML tags
          </li>
          <li>
            Geolocation API: This allows web applications to access the
            geographical location of the user, enabling location-based services
            or functionalities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drag-and-Drop API: This feature simplifies the implementation of
            drag-and-drop functionality, enhancing user interaction and
            experience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          HTML5 significantly advanced web technology, making it more versatile
          for developers and enhancing the user experience with rich media,
          graphics, and interactivity.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Form Controls: New form elements and attributes, such as date, time,
            email, url, search, and range, improve form handling and validation,
            making web forms more interactive and user-friendly.
          </li>
          <li>
            WebSockets: This technology enables full-duplex communication
            between a web browser and a server over a single, long-lived
            connection, allowing for more interactive web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offline Applications: With the application cache feature, web
            applications can run offline by caching essential elements,
            improving availability and performance.
